# Old Adobe School District: Camp Website
by Jose Ochoa

# project overview 
Old Adobe School District hosts a 6th grade camp to help students learn important life skills. The mission is to equip students with crucial life skills such as teamwork, cooperation, communication, and leadership. In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, the camp recognizes the pressing need to address social deficiencies resulting from prolonged periods of social isolation and remote learning. This transformative experience addresses the social challenges post-COVID by fostering teamwork, cooperation, communication, and leadership.

The five-day camp features engaging activities like team-building, river and ocean hikes, and a survival day. These experiences aim to bridge social gaps, providing a space for students to reconnect and grow together.

The project is complemented by a vibrant and playful website, specifically designed to resonate with elementary school students. The website features a primary color palette that reflects the camp's creative essence. The user-friendly design incorporates easy-to-read text, ensuring accessibility for all users. This online platform serves as a window into the lively and colorful world of the Old Adobe 6th Grade Camp, offering information, updates, and a glimpse into the unique experiences that await our young campers.
